When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    It is convenient to work in a remote directory if you access files from more than one computer/device. It is also necessary to have files available remotely when working with other developers.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	You would want to have more control over what information is stored on your local system and automatically pulling changes from the remote may overwrite data you have changed locally.
