What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	the .git directory is created where the meta data is collected for the commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging directory allow you to organize the files that are included in a commit. This is valuable because you can logically organize files that need to be tracked together.
